 Yes, it makes a difference.The tests take a longer time to complete with a TreeMap than with a HashMap.
 
 When i invoke countWords multiple times for different String iterators, 
 all the string iterators will be placed in the same map and list.
 
 
 The Iterator abstraction allows the addition of entries to the map 
 by making WordCounter testable
 
 
 the top ten words are
    the=33282
    of=18016
    and=12845
    a=12717
    to=12450
    in=9387
    was=7788
    that=6601
    he=6202
    his=5529
